I've spent a lot of time lately working with Material Design/Material-UI and I felt like some of my CSS skills were getting rusty. I'd been using MD because it kept me from spending hours and hours trying to figure out exactly how I wanted to position components. Frontend Mentor does the same thing by giving me an already thought out design.</p>\n<p>For my first challenge I went with one of the \"Newbie\" designated designs just to see what it was all about. And I can say that I love it and will be doing more of these. The downloaded file gave me all the images and font choices and the colors that I needed to create the design.</p>\n<p>All I had to do was copy and paste it into my Gatsby hello-world starter and get to work creating components.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://beta.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1\">Design!</a></p>\n<p>And my (not quite finished) <a href=\"https://alilynnefrontendmentor.firebaseapp.com/\">Result!</a></p>\n<p>Hoping to get to doing another one soon where I walk through my process of breaking the project down into parts and getting started.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"2019_08_29_made_another"}}}
