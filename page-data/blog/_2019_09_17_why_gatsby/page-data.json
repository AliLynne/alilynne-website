The open source maintainer I'm working with on GitConsensus can edit and deploy the code in the same way I do, so no major overhead of teaching them how to code front end stuff or use a big CMS.</p>\n<p>Not requiring a content database is huge.

Right now my blog uses Stripe to process monthly donation, ko-fi for one off donations, Just Comments for the comments.</p>\n<p>JWT's!</p>\n<p>Flexibility of Gatsby is superb. I can start with a simple landing page for a client and add functionality as necessary. If they later decide they want a blog or a storefront, I can add those and have a variety of ways to do it too.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"_2019_09_17_why_gatsby"}}}
