## I Can't Help Myself

I stumbled onto [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) a couple of weeks ago and I've finally gotten around to doing a challenge. 

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a website that streamlines the process for practicing front end developers to create real projects. I've spent a lot of time lately working with Material Design/Material-UI and I felt like some of my CSS skills were getting rusty. I'd been using MD because it kept me from spending hours and hours trying to figure out exactly how I wanted to position components. Frontend Mentor does the same thing by giving me an already thought out design.

For my first challenge I went with one of the "Newbie" designated designs just to see what it was all about. And I can say that I love it and will be doing more of these. The downloaded file gave me all the images and font choices and the colors that I needed to create the design.

All I had to do was copy and paste it into my Gatsby hello-world starter and get to work creating components.

And my (not quite finished) [Result!](https://alilynnefrontendmentor.firebaseapp.com/)

Hoping to get to doing another one soon where I walk through my process of breaking the project down into parts and getting started.
