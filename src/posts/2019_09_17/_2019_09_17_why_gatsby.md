JAMstack = JavaScript, API's, Markup

load times are important to me because I want everyone, regardless of who or where they are or what device they might be using, to be able to access my site

- i wanted something that was fun to work with
- need to be able to access different api's in different places on the site
- load quickly
- still contain all the fun stuff of modern web pages/apps

"a general rule for maximum performance is to perform the fewest steps possible" 


I love that I can set up a site that even my mom could deploy if she had to. 

"It’s an amazingly addictive way to develop" - can confirm

"Developers, content authors, and automated processes are all saving a living history of the site right to the same place—the repository—which acts as one source of truth."

This is the best part so far. The open source maintainer I'm working with on GitConsensus can edit and deploy the code in the same way I do, so no major overhead of teaching them how to code front end stuff or use a big CMS.

Not requiring a content database is huge. But also, I have the option of adding a content database as needed.

I can use all sorts of API's. Right now my blog uses Stripe to process monthly donation, ko-fi for one off donations, Just Comments for the comments.

JWT's!

Flexibility of Gatsby is superb. I can start with a simple landing page for a client and add functionality as necessary. If they later decide they want a blog or a storefront, I can add those and have a variety of ways to do it too.
