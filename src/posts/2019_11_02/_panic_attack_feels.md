## TV Portrayals of PTSD are... frustrating

If you've seen PTSD portrayed in TV or movies you've probably seen a man, most likely a veteran, having a panic attack and hallucinating because they've heard something that sounds like gun fire or bombs. 

Or you've seen him screaming at his wife and kids for apparently no reason.

Or sitting at bar drowning his sorrows with a bottle of whiskey.

For some people with PTSD, this is likely an accurate portrayal. But it's also often the only image of people with PTSD that the public at large is given. 

It turns out that [“women are twice as likely to develop PTSD, experience a longer duration of posttraumatic symptoms and display more sensitivity to stimuli that remind them of the trauma.”](https://www.psycom.net/PTSD-symptoms-women) But most people have never seen this. They have no idea what it looks like or feels like for a woman who isn't a veteran who has PTSD. I can't speak for anyone, I can only tell you what it feels like to me, and what people tell me it looks like from the outside.

## Complex PTSD

You've likely heard about PTSD, but do you know what C-PTSD is? 
[Complex PTSD comes in response to chronic traumatization over the course of months or, more often, years.](https://www.beautyafterbruises.org/what-is-cptsd) (This is a wonderful article, I highly recommend reading it.)

This is what I have. I didn't experience one traumatic event, I experienced hundreds, over the course of decades.
