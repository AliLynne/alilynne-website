- What does 'favor object composition over class inheritance' mean?
  - code reuse should be achieved by assembling smaller units of functionality into new objects instead of inheriting from classes and creating object taxonomies.
- What are two-way data binding and one-way data flow, and how are they different?
- Monolithic vs microservice architecture
  - Pros & Cons
- Asynchronous programming - why it's important in JavaScript
- Event delegation
